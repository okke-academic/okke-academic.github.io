We study the problem of an online advertising system that wants to optimally spend
an advertiserâ€™s given budget for a campaign across multiple platforms, without knowing
the value for showing an ad to the users on those platforms. We model this challenging
practical application as a Stochastic Bandits with Knapsacks problem over T rounds of
bidding with the set of arms given by the set of distinct bidding m-tuples, where m is
the number of platforms. We modify the algorithm proposed in Badanidiyuru et al., to extend it to the case of multiple platforms to obtain an algorithm for both the
discrete and continuous bid-spaces. Additionally we give almost matching lower bounds. Finally, we use a real-world data set from
a large internet online advertising company with multiple ad platforms and show that
our algorithms outperform common benchmarks and satisfy the required properties
warranted in the real-world application.
